# Releasing a new version of Splink

Splink is regularly updated with releases to add new features or bug fixes to the package.

Below are the steps for releasing a new version of Splink:

1. On a new branch, update [**pyproject.toml**](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [**__init__.py**](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/blob/master/splink/__init__.py) with the latest version.
2. Open a pull request to merge the new branch with the master branch (the base branch).
3. Once the pull request has been approved, merge the changes and generate a new release in the [releases section of the repo](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/releases), including:

- Choosing a new release tag (which matches your updates to [**pyproject.toml**](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [**__init__.py**](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/blob/master/splink/__init__.py)). Ensure that your release tag follows [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning). The target branch should be set to master.

- Generating release notes. This can be done automatically by pressing the 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/master/docs/img/releases/notes_button.png) button. 

This will give you release notes based off the Pull Requests which have been merged since the last release.

For example
